# Pacman-AI-Berkeley-Project

The whole project contains implementation of depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. 
These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.
Moreover, the game is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem, including implementation of multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, 
as well as designing evaluation functions.

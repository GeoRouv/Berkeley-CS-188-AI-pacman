Comments on Pacman Project 2:

Question 1: I estimate distances between Pacman and food dots and return the maximum of all.

2nd question: I made a minimax recursive function to return the appropriate decision about Pacman.

3rd and 4th question: Implemented according to class slides and theory.

5th question: I made a linear combination with the variables (distance to the nearest
food dot, closest ghost, number of capsules on the grid, number of frightened ghosts,
current score) and returned it.
